Join Our Online Classroom!

To make sure that you all succeed with this course, 
we have an online community of hundreds of thousands of students 
(I know, it's a big community!) helping to answer questions 
and talk about all things programming, technology, and business! 
You can also speak to past students who are now successful students 
working at some of the top tech companies and get advice from them.

A lot of companies use Discord to communicate across teams 
therefore it is a valuable tool for you to learn as you become a developer. 
In the spirit of keeping the course as useful as possible for employment this year, 
we are introducing a Discord online classroom where you can: 

- Introduce yourself 
- Ask the community questions 
- Get help with exercises 
- Meet other students around the world 
- Learn how to answer questions 
- Learn from each other

Many students have said this is the best part of the course 
as you will feel like you are learning in a classroom 
rather than by yourself in front of a computer. 
I know it isn't for everybody, but being able to ask questions 
and help others when they have questions is the best way to learn. 

The Discord community should give you faster replies to your questions 
from the community, while learning another valuable tool of a programmer.

Once there, you can sign up and click on different channels to explore different topics.  

If you are new to Discord we have written up a quick tutorial for you right here.
I'll see you inside!
