Join Our Open Source Projects!

The time is here! Many of you have been asking on Discord 
when our group projects / open source projects will begin.

Well, today is the start of something amazing 
with our community of 400,000+ students:  
You can now join open source projects created by our community, 
and then work with fellow students to build the next app or startup. 
Why would you want to do this?

Working in teams with fellow students will prepare you for the job market 
where you will be working with others using Github. 

 You can expand your portfolio by adding projects you have worked on with others. 

 You contribute to open source.

 On your resume, you will be able to showcase 
 that you started an open source project and self organized with your fellow students. 
 I don't know about you, but I would hire someone who shows initiative like that :). 

So how do you get started?

There is a special section I have added to the course: 
"Git + Github + Open Source Projects" 
where I take you through a step by step video 
on how to contribute to open source projects and build real life projects.

However, I only recommend starting to contribute to open source once you get to that section. I put this quick lesson here in case someone who has a bit of experience already with development wants to get started on this right away. Otherwise, see you in that section!
