Resources: Your Text Editor

There are a lot of text editors to chose from. 
Some are paid, some are free. 
For this course, you can use any text editor you would like. 
The free options that I really enjoy using as well are:

-Atom
https://atom.io/
-Visual Studio Code
https://code.visualstudio.com/

You can always hop on over to Discord and ask fellow students 
what their favourite Text Editor is!
Finally, you can have a reference for any tools and resources 
used throughout this course in the open source document contributed 
by one of your fellow students:

We even have student generated subtitle files for those students 
that may not speak english as their first language:
