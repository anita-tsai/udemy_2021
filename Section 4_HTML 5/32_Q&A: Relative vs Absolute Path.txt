1. Relative path

The difference here is that the relative path 
is using the file protocol and that means 
that this web-page - I can't really access it outside of my computer.

This is using something called a relative path.

If I go into my 'index.html' I am saying to link to 'newpage.html' 
relative to where 'index.html' is.
So if we go to our desktop you see that 'index.html'
lives in the same directory, which is the desktop, as 'newpage.html'.
So I can reference it through here. 

If I created a new folder or let's say, "test" I would have to reference it this way.

So let's let's check here.
If I save this and go into the web-page refresh and click "New Page" 
I'll get "Your file was not found."
But now if I go into my desktop and create "test" 
and I put the new page in here and let's bring back

2. Absolute path

If I wanted this anchor tag, this 'New Page' to actually link to something, maybe another website, maybe

to this hilarious gif. Well I can copy this link, open up my Sublime Text, and now I can just copy this

with the https protocol.

And now this is an absolute link. No matter where I reference this -

if I put it into 'newpage.html', or 'index.html', no matter what, this link will get me to this

gif.

So let's test that out:

I save this, I refresh, and I click on 'New Page', and look at that.

We have the gif.
